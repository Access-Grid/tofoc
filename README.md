# TOFOC - Tiny Open Format Offline Credential 
MIFARE DESFire shares no opinion about how applications or even file data should be formatted. This intends to be an open format for 64 bytes of data, where you can do quite a lot. It's purpose is to be open and allow for anyone to suggest edits, as well as provide a few reference implementations. More coming soon.
